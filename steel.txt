Explain what the simple List component does?
Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. Let us see how we transform Lists in regular JavaScript.
The map() function is used for traversing the lists. In the below example, the map() function takes an array of numbers and multiply their values with 5. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable multiplyNums and log it.
